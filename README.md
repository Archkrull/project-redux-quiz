# Redux quiz group project

Movie qoutes Quiz by
Group 1: Lisa, Linda, Neah, Nina & Viktor

The brief was to create a multiple question quiz game with Redux, using selectors and actions to access props from store.

This week is a group programming project, to work as a dev team in more ways than only mob programming. To agree on quiz topic and design. 


## The problem

One challange for the week have been our very diffrent working schedules. So we have used a google document for keeping track of our progress for each working session done. We have mainly worked together with mob-programming, but also with branched off manageable smaller tasks in pairs or as individual work. 

We have learned valuable lessons regarding making changes during the process in both planning, design and dividing of work, depending on the different challenges we have faced.

If we hade more time, 
- structure styled-components and Global-styles for pages vs. components
- Change on first page, to start the quiz when countdown hits zero.
- added some fancy function like timer.
